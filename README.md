Hotel management involves coordinating multiple organizational processes, including room reservations, check-ins and check-outs, room availability tracking, and billing. This project aims to design and implement a Hotel Management System (HMS) that streamlines these tasks, ensuring efficiency and ease of operation.

The HMS supports four user roles, each with specific functions to enhance usability and workflow:
	•	Administrator – Manages overall system operations, including user accounts and data.
	•	Hotel Staff – Handles reservations, check-ins, check-outs, and room management.
	•	Customer – Books rooms and interacts with hotel services.
	•	Guest – Uses hotel facilities without requiring an account.

Developed in ANSI C, the HMS leverages logical control structures, arrays, pointers, structures, unions, and file handling to ensure optimal performance. By employing modular programming, the system remains well-structured, maintainable, and scalable. Beyond fulfilling core functional requirements, the project also focuses on enhancing usability, security, and future expandability.
